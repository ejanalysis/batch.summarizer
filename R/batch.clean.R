#' @title Function that cleans up raw output of EJSCREEN batch processor
#' @description Takes the raw output version of batch buffer results and cleans it up
#'   to make it ready for batch.summarize function
#'   Note this drops rows with no pop data - assumes those lack EJSCREEN batch results since they are in VI/Guam/etc.
#' @param x Required. The output of the batch processor that runs EJSCREEN buffer report once per site.
#' @param namesfile Must specify either namesfile, or both oldcolnames and newcolnames. A csv filename, of file that maps fieldnames from those found in raw output of batch processor 
#'   to more useful and friendly names that make more sense to me. Default had been included but now left out - used to use 'map_batch_to_friendly_fieldnames_2018.csv'
#'   If function is called with the special value namesfile='keepnames' then the names are unchanged from those in x.
#' @param oldcolnames Optional. The names to be found in x, ignored if namesfile specified.
#' @param newcolnames Optional. The corresponding names to change them to, ignored if namesfile specified.
#' @author ejanalyst info@ejanalysis.com
#' @return the output is the output
