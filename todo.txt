*summary rows tab: indicatorsort field is nice when 1st transpose option picked, but if 2d picked, then Stat_or_Site field needs to be fixed so it sorts sites using lead.zeroes() and the stat rows need some prefix like stat001: , stat002: , etc. that appears before the first site 001 does.

Create an executive summary text tab

Create text tables of results like AZ's:
- Demog Tables: 
    * table 1. Pop and 6 D's as count nearby, %D nearby (but not for pop), count in US, %D in US. 
    * table 2. And stat test that avg site's D is > US avg D. 
    * table 3. And stat test of # of sites whose D stat is >USavg.
 - ***aggregated stat summary: 7 rows=pop and 6 Ds, cols= US % (count for pop), nearby %, % diff in those %s near vs US, stat sig for table 1, & 2.
- Text a few paragraphs on each demog variable, explaining stats and significance results.
- Region & State tally tables: Table of states in rows, with total pop nearby & # of sites, table of regions w same, & grand total row on each.
- Sites tables: 1 row per site, 1 col each for name, id, region, state, pop, & 6Ds

Fix the bar and hist plot downloads.

maybe download a whole standard report of several plots.

Provide a way to reset to go back to use the default fieldname mappings after user has loaded their own custom fieldname mappings.

Check when fieldnames are renamed - when custom mappings file is uploaded, when new batch data is uploaded, etc.

long list of percentiles takes up too much room on 1st tab - make it dropdown like multiple selectize widget, or just cut it.

Maybe allow download of table as sorted and transposed, not just in default format for download.

summary cols doesn't appear until summary rows is viewed once?

barplot legend blocks view of some bars at right

barplot and histo download buttons at left are crowding the settings heading .move to upper left ? or move settings a bit right?

histogram - possibly change selection of indicator from very long pulldown list of all into separate radiobuttons picking E/D/Ej and then pulldown that dynamically selects which of that category you want. At least use selectInput( selectize=FALSE) to view more rows in pulldown
