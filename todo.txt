To do / issues

** Not sure I really need to display uploaded file on first tab. It is also on the other 2 tabs with more useful info.

Create an executive summary text tab

Create text tables of results like AZ's

Fix the bar and hist plot downloads.

maybe download a whole standard report of several plots.

long list of percentiles takes up too much room on 1st tab - make it dropdown like multiple selectize widget, or just cut it.

Maybe allow download of table as sorted and transposed, not just in default format for download.

summary cols doesn't appear until summary rows is viewed once?

barplot legend blocks view of some bars at right

barplot and histo download buttons at left are crowding the settings heading .move to upper left ? or move settings a bit right?

histogram - possibly change selection of indicator from very long pulldown list of all into separate radiobuttons picking E/D/Ej and then pulldown that dynamically selects which of that category you want. At least use selectInput( selectize=FALSE) to view more rows in pulldown
