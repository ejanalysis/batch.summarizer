  # This is a function to read a set of csv files saved from EJSCREEN tabular view
  # and compile / format them and save them in format provided by output of batch processing tool
  # so they can be uploaded by batch summarizer to be analyzed as if they had come from the batch processing tool.
  # This allows users with access to EJSCREEN, but not the batch tool, to use the batch summarizer
  # to get summary reports/ graphics on a group of buffer reports (i.e., standard reports on multiple points) (or block group reports if extended to that)
