Description: This is a shiny app that will be turned into an R package. The
    app displays summary stats and graphics for an uploaded file of raw results of
    EJ buffer analysis (from batch tool or from several manually saved csv buffer
    reports). The only relevant public tool or dataset is the example built into
    this demo. Uses R's shinyapps tools to demonstrate an interactive web-based app.
