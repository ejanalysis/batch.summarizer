Package: batch.summarizer
Title: Summarize Multiple Buffer Reports from the (nonpublic) Batch Tool for EJSCREEN 
Description: This is a shiny app, developed as an R package. The
    app displays summary stats and graphics for an uploaded file of raw results of
    EJ (environmental justice) buffer analysis (from the EJSCREEN batch tool 
    or from several manually saved csv buffer reports). EJSCREEN is public but the batch 
    tool is not. The only relevant public tool or dataset is the example built into this 
    demo. Uses R's shinyapps tools to demonstrate an interactive web-based app.
