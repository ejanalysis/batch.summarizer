to do 

******- fix tables that don't display - full 2 big tables of details and also states sum counts

- ensure using latest pop totals/ ACS data - is any needed now other than what ejscreen dataset already has from package ejscreen?? just median and mean were the issue, not counts??

***- clarify if can correctly report those stats using EPA batch tool since it double counts peope near >1 sit.
(R batch fast tool fixed that but needs repair)


- fix Table 3. Do most of these sites have demographics above the US average (not median)?
  to compare to median not avg

- maybe clarify / calc raw value for US median person? 
is avg of percentiles the same as percentile of the avg person's raw score? probably not 
... in barplots, summary tables, and/or detail tables?


- exec sum could show ranked E by ratio to US mean? (as in table)

- add a barplot of RATIO local to US avg (as in table) *** would be nice to have. sorted.

- exec sum could show barplot on same page?? or pick a standard key plot or two?

- could use markdown etc. to create formatted report with graphics?
