	# fips is a character or numeric FIPS code, or vector of them (e.g., Census Bureau FIPS code for a block, block group, tract, county, or state)
	# length.desired is a numeric specifying how many characters should be in the corrected FIPS code, including any leading zeroes that are needed. This can be different for each corresponding fips - they are handled pairwise.
	# Returns a character string that is the corrected FIPS code, or vector of them, now including a leading zero whenever needed to bring a fips to the correct number of characters as specified by length.desired.

	fips <- paste( paste( rep( rep("0", length(length.desired)), length.desired), collapse=""), fips, sep="") 
	# does that work vectorized?

	# or maybe this, but can't say length.desired[i] unless it has same length as fip & can't handle recycling also:

	# state		2	(2 cumulative)
	# county	3	(5 cum)
	# tract		6	(11 cum) (11 digits is ambiguous if not sure leading zero is there)
	# block group 	1	(12 cum) (12 digits is ambiguous if not sure leading zero is there)
