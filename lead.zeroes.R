	# fips is a character or numeric FIPS code, or vector of them (e.g., Census Bureau FIPS code for a block, block group, tract, county, or state)
	# length.desired is a numeric specifying how many characters should be in the corrected FIPS code, including any leading zeroes that are needed. This can be different for each corresponding fips - they are handled pairwise.
	# Returns a character string that is the corrected FIPS code, or vector of them, now including a leading zero whenever needed to bring a fips to the correct number of characters as specified by length.desired.

	# or maybe this, but can't say length.desired[i] unless it has same length as fip & can't handle recycling also:

	# state		2	(2 cumulative)
	# county	3	(5 cum)
